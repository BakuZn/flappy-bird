Flappy Bird Game
A simple implementation of the popular Flappy Bird game using Pygame.

Gameplay: The bird moves under gravity, and the player can jump by pressing the space bar.

Pipe Generation: Pipes are generated randomly and move across the screen.

Scoring: Points are awarded when the bird successfully passes through a pair of pipes.
